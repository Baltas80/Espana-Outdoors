# Valhalla production deployment

España Outdoor delegates outdoor routing to the mature Valhalla engine. The repository contains deployment tooling, but the production instance and regional OSM tiles remain external infrastructure.

## Runtime contract

The mobile client receives only the first-party `VALHALLA_BASE_URL`. In production this URL must be HTTPS and must not point to the public Valhalla demo endpoint.

Required production properties:

- Valhalla image pinned to `3.9.0`.
- Spain regional tiles built from an approved OSM/Geofabrik extract.
- Health endpoint exposed only through the controlled routing service.
- Reverse proxy/TLS termination in front of Valhalla.
- No public direct exposure of port 8002.
- Backups or reproducible rebuild procedure for the regional tile set.
- Monitoring for `/status` and route latency/error rates.

## Build Spain tiles

Run the build from a controlled Linux host with Docker:

```bash
OSM_SPAIN_PBF_URL="https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/spain-latest.osm.pbf" \
  ./ops/valhalla/build-spain.sh
```

The generated PBF and Valhalla tiles are intentionally outside Git. For reproducible production rebuilds, record the exact source URL/date and artifact digest in the infrastructure change record before deployment.

## Start the service

```bash
cd ops/valhalla
docker compose up -d
```

The compose file binds Valhalla to loopback on port 8002. Put the HTTPS reverse proxy in front of it and expose only the proxy publicly.

## Smoke test

With the service reachable at the configured URL:

```bash
VALHALLA_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8002" ./ops/valhalla/smoke-test.sh
```

The smoke test validates service health and a real pedestrian route response. It does not fabricate a fallback route.

## Mobile configuration

The Flutter application accepts:

```text
VALHALLA_BASE_URL=https://routing.example.com/
```

Routing is disabled when this value is absent or invalid. HTTP endpoints are accepted only in debug/development configuration.
