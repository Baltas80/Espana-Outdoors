# España Outdoor — External Services Contract Matrix

Status date: 2026-09-24

This document is the production gate for external services. A service is **not production-ready** until its account/terms are actually accepted and its endpoint has been verified. No credentials or URLs are fabricated in this repository.

| Service | Selected approach | Required contract/account | Current state | Production evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PMTiles storage | Cloudflare R2 + controlled custom HTTPS domain | R2 account/bucket, API token, domain | BLOCKED: external account/domain not configured | HTTPS URL + 206 Range + checksum |
| OSM data | Geofabrik OSM PBF + ODbL attribution | Compliant use/attribution | READY TO BUILD | PBF checksum + attribution |
| Routing | Self-hosted Valhalla | Compute/storage/operations account | BLOCKED: hosting account not provisioned | `/status` + route/elevation smoke tests |
| Weather/live data | AEMET OpenData | API key and current API terms | BLOCKED: production API key not configured | Authenticated health/data check |
| Rescue Link | Dedicated production hosting/domain | Hosting/domain + operational controls | BLOCKED: external infrastructure not provisioned | HTTPS health check + authenticated integration test |
| Android distribution | Google Play Console | Developer account + Developer Distribution Agreement | BLOCKED: store account/configuration not verified | Internal/closed release gate |
| iOS distribution | Apple Developer Program / App Store Connect | Developer membership + agreements/certificates | BLOCKED: production account/configuration not verified | TestFlight/release gate |

## Verified external facts

### AEMET
AEMET OpenData requires an API key for programmatic access. AEMET's July 2026 notice says newly issued API keys have a three-month expiry, so the production integration must include key rotation rather than assuming an indefinite credential. The application must not ship the key in the mobile binary; the gateway owns the credential.

### Valhalla
Valhalla is open source and can be run on infrastructure controlled by the project. The official documentation recommends Docker for running a server and documents building routing tiles from OSM extracts. A public demo server exists, but it is subject to fair-use/rate limits and is **not** selected as the production dependency for España Outdoor.

### Cloudflare R2
R2 pricing currently includes a free tier and no Internet egress charge for the standard storage class, but storage and request operations are billable above the included allowance. The final production cost must be recorded after estimating the actual PMTiles traffic profile.

### Google Play
Google requires a developer account, acceptance of the Developer Distribution Agreement, a registration fee, and identity/account verification. Personal and organization accounts have different requirements; the final account type must be selected before store release.

## Contract checklist

For every provider, record before production:

- Provider/legal entity
- Service/product
- Account owner
- Billing owner
- Contract / terms URL
- Licence and permitted use
- Data processing/DPA requirements
- Data retention
- Data region/location
- Pricing and expected monthly cost
- Rate limits/quotas
- SLA/availability terms
- Security responsibilities
- Incident/support channel
- Cancellation/export process
- Renewal/expiry date
- Production endpoint
- Health-check evidence
- Secret/configuration location

## Non-negotiable rules

1. Never commit secrets to Git.
2. Never hard-code a fake production endpoint.
3. Never use a public routing demo as the production routing backend.
4. Never distribute AEMET credentials in the mobile application.
5. Never call the real 112 number during QA; emergency behavior is tested with a non-dialing test adapter/sandbox.
6. Never declare a service production-ready based only on code/CI. The external account and endpoint must exist and be verified.
